How to install bee:

   make install

This will install bee to PREFIX=/usr

Change installation prefix:

   make PREFIX=/usr/local install

   Be sure to provide installation prefixes during 
   make and make install if you want to first build and
   later install bee 
   (e.g. make PREFIX=/usr/local && make PREFIX=/usr/local install)


Change destination directory for temporary installation 
and later packaging:

   make DESTDIR=/path/to/destdir PREFIX=/usr/local install

All variables available to change installation directories:

   PREFIX     = /usr
   EPREFIX    = ${PREFIX}
   SBINDIR    = ${EPREFIX}/sbin
   BINDIR     = ${EPREFIX}/bin
   LIBDIR     = ${EPREFIX}/lib
   LIBEXECDIR = ${EPREFIX}/libexec
   DATADIR    = ${PREFIX}/share
   MANDIR     = ${DATADIR}/man
   SYSCONFDIR = ${PREFIX}/etc
   
   DESTDIR    =

Cleanup build: e.g. after building with wrong prefixes

   make clean

Rebuild and install with new prefix in destdir:

   make clean install PREFIX=/usr/local DESTDIR=/tmp/destdir

Install latest bee with bee (requires git to be installed):

   bee init $(bee download git://github.com/bee/bee.git) \
            --execute \
            --prefix=/usr/local

   bee update bee
