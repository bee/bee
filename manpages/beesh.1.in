.SH "HOWTO WRITE A BEE-FILE"
.SS "I have an url and want to build that stuff."
The simplest way to create a bee file is to run
.BR "bee init <url-to-sources>" .
This will end up in a bee-file looking like
.P
.RS
.TQ
#!/bin/env beesh
.TQ
SRCURL[0]="http://<url-to-sources>"
.RE
.P
To make it easier to you to apply changes to your build your bee-file contains some commented stuff too.
.SS "Is there a way to customize the build process?"
.P
We provide you with a set of functions that you may adjust for your needs. These are
.BR mee_patch ", " mee_configure ", " mee_build " and " mee_install .
To each of these functions you may append
.BR _pre " or " _post .
Use these functions to adjust the build process to your needs.
.SS "Where are my .la files? or I don't want that documentation stuff!"
.B bee
supports two ways of excluding files so they won't appear in your final bee-package. On the one hand there are many files
that are automatically excluded by bee and one the other hand you can specify files that you wnat to exclude from your
bee-package.
.P
To disable the bee built-in auto exclusion add
.B disable_autoexclusion
to your bee-file.
.P
To exclude files use
.B EXCLUDE
and provide a quoted 'space' separated list of regular expressions.
.P
.RS
EXCLUDE=( ^/usr/share/gtk-doc ^/usr/share/doc )
.RE
.SS "Argh! My build takes so much time.."
You might discover that
.B bee
takes quiet a lot time after packaging your software. This is because
.B bee
creates an archive of all build process related files (sources, patches, ..). If you don't want this run your bee-file with
.P
.RS
bee-file-1.0-0.bee
.B \-\-no-archive-build
