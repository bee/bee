Some dependencies we know about:

bash-4:
  we nee bash version for:
    - declare -A 
    - ${var,,}
    - ${var^^}

tar-1.26:
  we know this version works, we don't know which version does not work
  but we need support for (unbroken) --tranform
  (we will add exact version at a later time)

coreutils:
  for various small linux tools
  - env needs to be available as /usr/bin/env

wget:
  for downloading software

gzip, bzip2, xz, ..:
  to extract source code archives
  
  tar decides which compress utility to use - so any utility
  supported by your tar is also supported by bee (tar xf)

man:
  to read our minimalistic manpages 8)

to be continued - please let us know if you find additional dependencies.
